This plugin sorts the content on ICIJ's Discourse instance by the projects that users are members of, as dictated by Xemx. The projects, in turn, determine the content that the users are able to see and interact with on the Discourse instance. It is important that changes related to this functionality remain isolated to this repository and the corresponding directory in ICIJ's Discourse repository, as to limit conflicts with Discourse's core code base.
